  TCC - As Aventuras de Salazar
</h1>

A serious game I developed to my undergraduate thesis of my bachelor degree in computer science by the University of Caxias do Sul.
It's been developed in Unity, using C#, and it was originally built to be played on Android cellphones.
Its purpose is to help kids develop computational thinking.
Along with the project, the undergraduate thesis required a <a href="https://repositorio.ucs.br/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11338/3723/TCC%20Henrique%20Pagno%20de%20Lima.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">research paper<a> to be written.

To execute it, the project must be opened in Unity Version <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.6.3p1">5.6.3p1<a>.
